# Project Description
As stated earlier, the data behind my entire project comes from Pro Football Reference (https://www.pro-football-reference.com/) and the site provides access to the pro bowlers and their salaries and some other variables.

I will download the files and transport them as excel worksheets. Once I have them placed, I will get rid of the data I do not need and narrow down the focus on the charts.

I will add the average age of NFL Pro Bowlers through a visualization and which team had the most pro bowlers.

Finally, I will compare the salaries of Pro Bowlers and see if they are getting paid the highest.
